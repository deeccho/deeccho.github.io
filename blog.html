					Noticed that people here like to say that as a form of goodbye even though often times “later” may actually 
					mean some uncertain amount of time into the future, or quite realistically, even never.

					Well, I don’t know if I’ll ever be back here again but I sure hope to return someday. 
					I guess for now, this is a “see ya later, Australia”.

					It’s funny how the most “unreal”-looking places, at least for a girl from the city, 
					are the ones designed by nature. For someone who’s used to seeing buses and cars and bustling streets 
					all the time, the feeling of sitting down on the rocks, knees hugged against my chest, slight breeze 
					from a distance, and just having a (nearly) unobstructed view of the lake, even just for half a minute, 
					is completely destressing.

						Sorry for lack of updates…I have limited Internet access because I’m in New Zealand this week but 
						when I do get Wifi I don’t seem to be able to post any pictures :( But I promise to post something more in 
						depth eventually (maybe when I return to Sydney lol)
						<br><br>
						But seriously, thanks for following my posts if you have been!

						Auckland is a few hours away from this gem of a place called Hobbiton, where parts of The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit 
						were filmed. I’ll admit that I don’t follow the books/movies, but this place is still worth visiting if you ever get the 
						chance to visit New Zealand. It’s a picturesque place where the man-made sets (hobbit holes and all) blend in harmoniously 
						with the green hills, mini lakes, and grazing flocks of sheep.

					Yayy day 1! It’s 4pm here in Sydney and jet lag makes me wanna nap so badly. But today was pretty productive because I got some 
					logistics dealt with and made a few friends along the way :) This morning I got picked up with several other exchange students 
					from my host uni. Turned out that in our group of seven, five of us were from the U.S., and out of those five, three of us were 
					from California. Small world, eh? 
					<br><br>
					Walked around and got lost on campus with a friend I made from the shuttle bus ride, and I really love the open feel of the campus. 
					Lots of grassy areas/lawns like Berkeley. Finally seeing places in real life after having anticipated doing so for months is a 
					strange but nice feeling. 
					<br><br>
					The apartment building I’m living in is really new and clean, but so far it feels more like a hotel room because the hallways are 
					empty and the living room itself is actually rather lifeless and cold (literally). But oh well, maybe I’ll warm up to it later.
					<br><br>
					Reminder of the day:<br>
					I forgot that people walk on the left here, so for the rest of the day I was consciously reminding myself to stay on the left after 
					I noticed how I was walking directly towards people coming in the opposite direction. Wups.
