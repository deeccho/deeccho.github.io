					It's funny how the most "unreal"-looking places, at least for a girl from the city, 
					are the ones designed by nature. For someone who's used to seeing buses and cars and bustling streets 
					all the time, the feeling of sitting down on the rocks, knees hugged against my chest, slight breeze 
					from a distance, and just having a (nearly) unobstructed view of the lake, even just for half a minute, 
					is completely destressing.

						Auckland is a few hours away from this gem of a place called Hobbiton, where parts of The Lord of the Rings/The Hobbit 
						were filmed. I'll admit that I don't follow the books/movies, but this place is still worth visiting if you ever get the 
						chance to visit New Zealand. It's a picturesque place where the man-made sets (hobbit holes and all) blend in harmoniously 
						with the green hills, mini lakes, and grazing flocks of sheep.

					Yayy day 1! It's 4pm here in Sydney and jet lag makes me wanna nap so badly. But today was pretty productive because I got some 
					logistics dealt with and made a few friends along the way :) This morning I got picked up with several other exchange students 
					from my host uni. Turned out that in our group of seven, five of us were from the U.S., and out of those five, three of us were 
					from California. Small world, eh? 
					<br><br>
					Walked around and got lost on campus with a friend I made from the shuttle bus ride, and I really love the open feel of the campus. 
					Lots of grassy areas/lawns like Berkeley. Finally seeing places in real life after having anticipated doing so for months is a 
					strange but nice feeling. 
					<br><br>
					The apartment building I'm living in is really new and clean, but so far it feels more like a hotel room because the hallways are 
					empty and the living room itself is actually rather lifeless and cold (literally). But oh well, maybe I'll warm up to it later.
					<br><br>
					Reminder of the day:<br>
					I forgot that people walk on the left here, so for the rest of the day I was consciously reminding myself to stay on the left after 
					I noticed how I was walking directly towards people coming in the opposite direction. Wups.

					Kind of like the equivalent to "no problem" or "you're welcome", except it just sounds so much nicer. I can only think of one 
					person back home who commonly uses this phrase, but in Australia I hear it everywhere. Can't help but think of "Hakuna Matata"
					from The Lion King every time someone says it.

					Today I visited the botanical gardens with Emily and Louise and got to read a little bit about Australian history, and how the Aboriginal people 
					were treated and discriminated against by European settlers. There was this walkway in the park where you could follow a timeline of significant 
					points in Australian history with regards to the Aboriginal people. It reminded me very much of the history between the Native Americans and the 
					European settlers in North America.
					<br><br>
					A difference I noticed between the two pieces of history was that the Australian government actually has a day called Sorry Day for people to formally 
					apologize to the indigenous people in public for mistreating them back then, whereas in America even though we have an Indigenous People Day, some 
					people still treat it as Christopher Columbus Day. I think this kind of unpleasant history is more brushed over in the U.S., but here in Australia 
					they are more transparent about the government’s past wrongdoings, and it shows in public exhibits like this one.

					So I have been pretty bad at updating this blog recently...but that's because I've been kept quite busy! Time is seriously flying by. 
					In the midst of basically midterm/project season here, I've been able to squeeze in some fun things here and there. Here are some 
					snapshot updates:
					<p><i>A night at Luna Park:</i></p>

					<p><i>Bondi Kite Festival:</i></p>
					<br>It was super packed here. Not sure if I would do something like this again, but it was a very beautiful day and I definitely 
					soaked up a lot of sun :P

					I guess first of all, sorry if this post is very rambly! There is so much I could talk about but I would probably bore you to death. 
					But please read on if you're curious at all :) I'm sure many of my pictures will also speak for themselves haha. 
					I don’t think four days in this city was nearly enough for me to explore all its pretty alleys, hidden little shops and artsy structures 
					on practically every street corner, but it was definitely enough to make me want to go back again some day.

						Visited Manly again today and stopped by the building that was used as the exterior of Gatsby's mansion in the latest film version of 
						The Great Gatsby! This castle-y building used to be a seminary and now functions as a school of management, which I thought was kind 
						of interesting. The only reason I found out about this place was because someone told me the other day that the 2013 version of 
						The Great Gatsby was actually filmed mostly in Sydney! 
						The filmmakers definitely did a lot of touch-up/digital enhancement to the actual building, but I think you can still see the 
						resemblance. Pretty awesome :)

					<div class = "post-date">NOV 8</div>
					<hr align="center" width="100%">
					<div class = "post-content">
					So I realize I've been using the terms "exchange" and "study abroad" interchangeably because to me, they both basically refer to the same experience 
					of studying at a foreign university. I should probably clarify that UNSW actually has two separate departments for exchange and study abroad, but I 
					always thought the only real difference was that exchange students came from universities that had partnerships with the host university, and study 
					abroad students didn't. It didn't really occur to me until I was talking to my friend today that there's actually a mutual exchange of students 
					between the two universities...or at least there's supposed to be? If that really is the case, I am pretty curious about whose spot I've temporarily 
					replaced here at UNSW/who has temporarily replaced me at Berkeley. It'd be very interesting to meet them and share our experiences about being at 
					each other's home universities.
